| **Special Actions** |                               |
| `Space`             | Hard drop (instant drop)      |
| `C`                 | Hold current piece            |
| **Game Controls**   |                               |
| `P`                 | Pause/unpause game            |
| `R`                 | Restart (on game over screen) |
| `Q`                 | Quit (on game over screen)    |

## Game Mechanics:

### Scoring System:
- **Single Line**: 100 × level
- **Double Lines**: 300 × level  
- **Triple Lines**: 500 × level
- **Tetris (4 Lines)**: 800 × level
- **Combo Bonus**: 50 × combo × level
- **Hard Drop Bonus**: 2 points per cell dropped

### Level Progression:
- Levels increase every 10 lines cleared.
- Drop speed increases with each level.
- Maximum challenge at higher levels with near-instant piece falling.

### 7-Bag Randomization:
Uses the modern Tetris piece generation system ensuring fair distribution:
- Each "bag" contains one of each piece type (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).
- Pieces are shuffled randomly within each bag.
- Prevents long droughts of specific pieces.

## Code Architecture:

### Main Classes:
- **`TetrisGame`**: Main game controller handling states, events, and rendering.
- **`Tetrimino`**: Individual piece management with rotation and collision detection.
- **`SoundManager`**: Procedural audio generation and sound effect management.
- **`Particle`**: Visual effects system for enhanced gameplay feedback.

### Game States:
- **Menu**: Professional start screen with control instructions.
- **Playing**: Active gameplay with full feature set.
- **Paused**: Game suspension with overlay.
- **Game Over**: Final statistics and restart options.

### Performance Features:
- **60 FPS**: Smooth gameplay with consistent frame rate.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized drawing routines for complex visual effects.
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of particles and effects.
- **Responsive Input**: Immediate control response without lag.

## Visual Effects:

### Particle System:
- **Line Clear Effects**: Explosion particles when lines are cleared.
- **Piece Lock Effects**: Small particle burst when pieces lock in place.
- **Dynamic Colors**: Randomized particle colors for visual variety.

### Screen Effects:
- **Screen Shake**: Dramatic effect for Tetris (4-line) clears.
- **Flash Effects**: Screen flashing for major events.
- **Glow Animation**: Animated glow around the current falling piece.
- **Line Clear Animation**: Smooth animated clearing of completed lines.

### Block Enhancement:
- **Gradient Blocks**: 3D appearance with lighting effects.
- **Enhanced Borders**: Multiple border layers for depth.
- **Ghost Piece**: Semi-transparent preview showing drop position.
- **Color Coding**: Familiar color mapping for the seven piece types.

## Statistics & Tracking:

### Performance Metrics:
- **PPS (Pieces Per Second)**: Measure of play speed.
- **LPS (Lines Per Second)**: Efficiency metric.
- **Game Time**: Total elapsed time.
- **Piece Distribution**: Count of each piece type used.

### Persistent Data:
- **High Scores**: Top 10 scores saved to `tetris_scores.json`.
- **Automatic Saving**: Scores saved automatically on game over.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of file system issues.

## Configuration:

### Sound Settings:
The game automatically detects sound capabilities:
- Falls back gracefully if NumPy is not installed.
- Continues without sound if audio system fails.
- Procedural generation creates sounds dynamically.

### Performance Tuning:
- 60 FPS target with automatic frame rate management.
- Particle count automatically managed for performance.
- Visual effects can be reduced on slower systems.

## Troubleshooting:

### Common Issues:
1. **No Sound**: Install NumPy (`pip install numpy`) or ignore - game works without sound.
2. **Slow Performance**: Reduce particle effects by modifying particle count in code.
3. **Installation Issues**: Ensure Python 3.6+ and `Pygame` are properly installed.

### System Requirements:
- **Minimum**: Python 3.6, `Pygame`.
- **Recommended**: Python 3.8+, `NumPy`.

## Gameplay Tips:

### Advanced Techniques:
- **T-Spins**: Use the hold piece strategically for complex clears.
- **Combo Building**: Chain multiple line clears for maximum scoring.
- **Speed Management**: Use soft drop to maintain control at higher levels.
- **Ghost Piece**: Plan moves using the ghost piece preview.

### Strategic Play:
- Monitor piece statistics to anticipate piece droughts.
- Use the next piece preview to plan 2-3 moves ahead.
- Hold piece is crucial for avoiding difficult situations.
- Focus on Tetris clears (4 lines) for maximum points.

## Version History:

### Features Added:
- Tetris-inspired color mapping and 7-bag piece generation.
